<h1>Big Bang Thoery</h1>
In the distant future, humanity has become an interstellar civilization, exploring the far reaches of the galaxy in search of knowledge, energy, and the origins of existence itself. Among the stars, Earth’s brightest minds have uncovered a shocking cosmic truth: some stars are not just balls of burning gas — they are Prime Stars, celestial bodies aligned with the mathematical resonance of prime numbers. <i>(Generate by GhatCPT)</i> <br><br>

    These stars exhibit unusual quantum patterns in their nuclear cores, subtly vibrating at frequencies that correspond to prime numbers — 2, 3, 5, 7, and beyond. While most Prime Stars are stable, recent cosmic simulations conducted by the Earth-based organization NOVA (Numerical Oscillation and Variable Astrophysics) reveal a terrifying phenomenon: when two Prime Stars with incompatible resonance — specifically those aligned with the primes 3 and 5 — come into close proximity, their conflicting quantum fields trigger a cataclysmic reaction.
    <br><br>
    This reaction doesn’t merely create a supernova — it resets space-time in the affected region, mimicking the conditions of a Big Bang.
    <br><br>
    When astronomers detect two such Prime Stars on a collision course in a neighboring galaxy, Earth has 13 years to act before the shockwave reaches the Milky Way and unravels their corner of the universe. As panic grips the planets, a divided council of interstellar civilizations must unite.
    <br><br>
    At the heart of this crisis is Dr. Kira Myles, a young quantum astrophysicist who discovers a pattern in the prime-based frequency sequences — a pattern that may hold the key to either halting the detonation or harnessing its creative power.
    <br><br>
    But the universe has secrets of its own. Could this not be a disaster, but a test — or a cosmic birth? One where every Big Bang is not the end… but the beginning of a Prime Genesis?
